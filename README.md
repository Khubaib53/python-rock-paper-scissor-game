# python-rock-paper-scissor-game
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple, command-line based program written in Python. In this game, players can compete against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the winner is determined by the standard rules where rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The game keeps a tally of the number of games won by both the player and the computer. Users can continuously play rounds of the game and quit at any time by entering 'q'. This project requires Python 3.x to run. To start playing, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory, and execute the script. This project provides a fun and interactive way to engage with basic Python programming and understand conditional logic and loops.
